# RawImage
Although I did not create this library myself, I had to include it in my repository for use in the Arduino CI pipeline. To utilize it as a library in the Arduino CLI pipeline, I needed to add it to a GitHub project. The original creator did not originally present it as a standalone library but rather included it in their own project. You can find the original creator of this library at https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Displaying-Photos/.
